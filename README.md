# JobTracker
*last updated: 25/11/25*

Applying for jobs can take time and when you're out of work it can be difficult to keep track. To make sure I knew what I had applied for, I tracked all my applications in a simple JSON array. As more things happened, I started to track them: interviews, rejections, sending CV's to recruiters. After a little while, I had a series of events that I could begin to analyse and see if I could improve on my application strategy.

I started this Marimo notebook to do some analysis on my applications and now I've built it up to add in some interactive components that allow me to log new.
